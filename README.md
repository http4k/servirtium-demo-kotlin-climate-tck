## Technology

The same as a Python, Java and Ruby version of a "Climate API" library demo, but for the Kotlin ecosystem demonstrating a SERVIRTIUM markdown format for service virtualization. See https://servirtium.dev

## Setup

This requires JDK 11. You'll have to go to Oracle.com to install the JDK, or 

```
brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
brew cask install java11

```

## Running the demo's tests

```
./gradlew test
```

That runs the tests: direct, playback and record. TODO: more description.
